# 📱 Campus Companion – RMIT Club, Event, and Food Ordering App

An Android mobile application designed to enhance campus life for RMIT students by providing easy access to clubs, events, food ordering, and study room availability — all in one place.

---

## 📖 Overview
**Campus Companion** was developed as part of my **Mobile Development** course at RMIT University.  
While RMIT already has Canvas for learning management, there was no dedicated app for non-academic student life.  
This project aims to fill that gap, offering a practical, feature-rich platform that connects students to campus activities and services.

## 💡 Why I Made This App
I wanted to build an app that simplifies how students engage with their campus community.  
From joining clubs and attending events to ordering food and finding study rooms, **Campus Companion** saves time and makes campus life more enjoyable.
